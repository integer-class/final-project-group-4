# Project Charter

## Project Title

Information Technology Room Tenant System

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the app is to streamline the process of borrowing rooms in JTI building for events, such as seminars, workshops, etc. The app will be used by the staff and faculty of JTI to manage the rooms and the events. The app will also be used by the students to book the rooms for their events. This app is made in hope of reducing the amount of paperwork and administrative workload being done manually.

## Project Objectives

- To create a system where the staff and faculty of JTI can manage the rooms and the events easily.
- To make it easier for students to book the rooms for their events.
- To reduce the amount of paperwork and administrative workload being done manually.
- To make the process of borrowing rooms in JTI building for events more efficient.

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- The project is a web app that can be accessed by the admins of the inventory using a web browser.
- The app should have a basic authentication feature to ensure that only the authorized users can access the app.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the inventory, such as adding, removing, and updating the room and event data.
- The admin and student should be able to see the list of rooms and events.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the users, such as adding, removing, and updating the users.
- The app should provide a way for students to borrow a room from the list. Each room can only be borrowed for a certain amount of time.
- The admins should be able to see the history of the room borrowings.
- The app should never give an invalid state such as the start of the borrowing time is after the end of the borrowing time.

### Out of Scope

- Integration with other systems, such as the university's student information system for Single Sign-On (SSO).

## Project Risks

- Technical Challenge: The project team members are not familiar with the tech stack used in the project.
- User Adoption: The users are not familiar with the app, and they are not willing to use it.
- Security: The app is not secure enough, and it can be hacked by malicious users to steal data or cause damage to the system.
- Data Loss: The data in the app is not backed up, and it can be lost due to hardware failure, etc.
- Scope Creep: The project team members keep adding new features to the app, and the project is never finished.

## Budget

TBD. I don't think we need a budget for this project, since we're not going to buy anything and we're not going to hire anyone. It's just a final project what do you expect.

## Project Success Criteria

- Fullfill all the requirements in the project scope.
- The app is secure enough to be used in production.
- The app is user-friendly and easy to use.
- The app is well-documented.
- The app is well-tested.
